# Race Day: The motorsports app for race track information


## Primary Features:
The goal of this app was to allow motorsport fans(users) to be able to upload info on race tracks around them on a mobile device.
A user can view different tracks by a specific series if they're only interested in a certain one(NASCAR, INDYCAR, F1, etc).
A user can edit those tracks if they're is something that needs updated.
A user can delete those tracks if they are no longer active.
A user can view all the current series.



## Target Audience:
Motorsport fans who want to be able to find race tracks near them, info on those tracks, and what race series runs them.


## Purpose and problems it solves:
To have one place for fans to get info on race tracks, instead of having to search each track individually on Google or Wikipedia.


## Getting Started:


1. In the terminal, create a directory
```bash
cd <new directory name>
```

2. Run 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Deadwing91/raceday-client.git
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Run the code
```bash
npm start
```
5. This will initialize the React app in your browser, but you won't be able to log into the site or access data without running the server side of this project. To download and start the server, go to https://github.com/Deadwing91/raceday-server and follow the README there.

6. Once you are running the server, create a new user, log in to view the site, and test out the features!

7. Race Day is a mobile app design, so make sure to toggle to a mobile device(iphone 12 Pro) in the Google Dev Tools(F12).


Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
